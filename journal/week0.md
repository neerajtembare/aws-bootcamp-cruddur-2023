# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework


### Created Architectural Diagram

- Created a basic architectural diagram to show the basic working of the project
- added frontend backend and other required resources for the architecture
- Its a conceptual diagram to show how things would work
- This diagram helps to get a general overview of the resources and stuff that we need to build out project

### Created Logical Diagram in Lucid
- Logical diagram is the next version of the conceptual diagram
- we use it to allocate specific services provied by our cloud provider which are required for the project
- logical diagram contains specific and detailed names of resources required
- it helps us design the a plan for implementation and also helps us estimate working cost based on the services we are using
- Created a new blank template
- selected the AWS icons
- Dragged and arranged all the required icons to build a logical diagram
- Downloaded the Momento logo in SVG format directly from google and uploaded it into the shapes
- Adjusted all the resources and services to make the diagram smaller and easy to understand
### Note - The white momento logo when downloaded as SVG makes the white background as PNG so its not visible properly in the Lucid Charts diagram , So i used the Green logo instead. You can then just change the background colour of the Image in lucid
